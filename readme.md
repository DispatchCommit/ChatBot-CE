# ChatBot Community Edition
## About
Back in 2015, we created a bot base for [StreamMe](https://stream.me) that was not open-source. We're changing that. We believe that we can help the community more by providing the code for the community to use and build on and here we are.

## Using
Upon release of the software, we will provide more information on the usage. For now, pleaser refere to [Compiling](#Compiling)

ChatBot-CE uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Review their documentaiton on installing the TypeScript compiler. Once installed, just run `npm run compile`.
